		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> I am a postdoctoral fellow at 
        <a href="http://math.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>.  Starting Fall 2022 I will be
        a <a href="https://www.ias.edu/scholar-type/veblen-research-instructor">Veblen Research Instructor</a> and NSF Postdoctoral Fellow  at <a href="http://math.princeton.edu/">Princeton 
        University</a>/<a href="https://www.ias.edu/">IAS</a>. You may also find me at the MSRI program on <a href="https://www.msri.org/programs/335">Floer Homotopy Theory</a> in Berkeley, CA. </p>

        <p>As a mathematician, I am interested in symplectic geometry, and I think about how the many pseudoholomorphic curves in a symplectic manifold are organized into elaborate and useful algebraic structures. Lately I've been finishing a project regarding several problems problems in higher-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, and am excited about
        the Fueter equations and about
        certain relations between 
        symplectic invariants and 
        number theory. </p>

        <p>Beyond that, I am interested in <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Arnold/quotations/">applications of mathematics</a>, broadly construed. It seems to me that the intersection of machine 
        learning, physics, geometry, and probability
        theory is both rich and important. </p>

        <p>I got my Ph.D from
         <a href="https://math.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> in 2021 under
         the direction of 
         <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~abouzaid/">Mohammed Abouzaid</a>.</p>

        <p>My favorite book is Edmund Spenser's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faerie_Queene">Faerie Queene</a>. </p>

        <li><a href="./rational_cm.pdf">Rational Quantum Cohomology of Steenrod Uniruled Manifolds</a>
        <br/>
        <em>This paper closes the gap between the usual formulation of the Chance-McDuff conjecture, which states that the existence of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism with finitely many periodic points forces nontrivial rational Gromov-Witten invariants, and  recent results that use methods in equivariant Floer theory to prove variants of this conjecture via equivariant, positive-characteristic Gromov-Witten invariants. The proof is a combination of a certain amount of `symplectic birational geometry' and a calculation using recently established properties of the quantum Steenrod algebra.</em></li>

        <br/>
        <em>I explain why certain conjectures of Kontsevich about cyclic homology of categories always hold for Fukaya categories, even though Efimov demonstrated that they do not hold in general. The proof gives a TQFT interpretation of the conjectures, and a conceptual perspective on why they turned out to be in error.  </em></li>

        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01325">Floer homology via Twisted Loop Spaces</a>, submitted. 
        <br/>
        <em>This is a paper about signs. I explain how to extract an integral variant of Lagrangian Floer homology from pseudoholomorphic curve moduli spaces which may not be orientable. This anwers a question of Witten and lets one prove stronger Lagrangian self-intersection bounds.  </em> </li>

        <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11737">Renormalization Group Flow as Optimal Transport</a><br/>
          <em>This paper gives a variational 
          formulation of a very general form of the
          renormalization group of statistical/quantum field theory in terms of an optimal transport problem. We see some interesting phenomena involving the regularization of the relative entropy in infinite dimensions. Beyond being of theoretical significance, this formalism should allow for the development of novel numerical tools to study physical systems by importing ideas from modern generative models. </em></li>
        <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02634">Light Field Networks: Neural Scene Representations with Single-Evaluation Rendering</a>, NeurIPS spotlight paper. <br/>
         <em> This paper proposes to represent 3d scenes by using a neural network to parameterize the colors of every ray hitting the scene. One uses meta-learning to learn a prior over consitent light fields, thus making rendering very cheap. It is implausible that the brain does ray-tracing! Amusingly, the space of oriented rays is a symplectic manifold, and the subspace of rays along which the light field changes discontinuously is a singular Lagrangian submanifold. 
    	<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09597">Stochastic natural gradient descent draws posterior samples in function space</a>, NeurIPS workshop paper. <br/>
    	<em>This discusses the (rather popular) connection between stochastic gradient descent and Bayesian inference, and looks at the connection from the perspective of natural gradients. I helped fix some errors regarding how changes of variables work in stochastic calculus. </em>

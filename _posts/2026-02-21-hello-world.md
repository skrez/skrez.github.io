This is my first blog post! I'm testing out my new Jekyll setup on GitHub Pages.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a simple, lightweight way to share my thoughts without dealing with complicated CMSs or databases.

## What's Next

Here are some topics I'm thinking about writing on:

- Topic one
- Topic two
- Topic three

I'm looking forward to writing more soon!
